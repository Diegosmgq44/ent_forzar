# Description

This script includes the function of two commands. One is /entorno to send police notices and the other is /forzar. 
For when you steal a car that the model, color and license plate of the stolen vehicle arrives to the police, 
as well as a mark on the gps where with the Y key you can mark it on your map.

# Instructions

Download the script from my github directly and copy it to the resources folder.
In the server.cfg file start it as ent_forzar(start ent_forzar)
